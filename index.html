        <li>Use <strong>SEMANTIC Markup</strong>whenever possible. This makes it clearer for screen readers and other

      <ul>
        <li>Always a good idea to check which branch you are on</li>
        <li>Make sure you are in the directory you want to code from</li>
        <li>Make sure you add a commit and message to keep track of what work has been done</li>

      <h2>JAVASCRIPT Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The pseudocode example is helpful</li>
        <ul>
          <li>var hasFuel = false;
            if (hasFuel == false) {
            //vehicle will fill up their gas tank
            console.log("let's get of this exit and get fuel")
            hasFuel == true
            }
          </li>
          <li>Variables are changeable if they are not const</li>
          <li>the loop checks the conditon (is hasFuel false?)</li>
          <li>if the condition is met, it runs the loop</li>
          <li>once the action has taken place, the variable changes to 'true'</li>
          <li>it will go up to the top and check again (is hasFuel false?)</li>
          <li>since the variable changed at the end of the loop, the condition is not met so the loop doesn't run again
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>CONTROL FLOW is the order in which the computer executes code in a script. Code is read from top to bottom.
        </li>
        <li>IF statements: code following if statement will only run if the condition is met.</li>
        <li>ELSE IF and ELSE: Additional conditions with different code following an IF statement.</li>
        <li>The computer looks to see which condition is <strong>truthy</strong> and then executes that code.</li>
        <li>ARRAY: a group of related data.</li>
        <li>Strings need quotes around them but BOOLEAN values and numbers do not when in an array.</li>
        <li>INDEX: each item in an array has a position marked by an index value [0, 1, 2, etc]</li>
        <li>FOR loops: These allow us to repeat an action/iteration based on a set number of times</li>
        <ol>
          <li>The first statment is the starting point for the loop. EX. we want to start at the beginning of an array
            so we will set x=0.</li>
          <li>The second statment is the condition. Ex. x is less than the length of the array</li>
          <li>The third and final statement is the action to iterate. Ex. x++ (this is shorthand for x+1). Now everytime
            the code loops, x will increase by 1 </li>
        </ol>
        <li>FUNCTION: groups a set of instructions that tells the computer what to DO. They define and reuse blocks of
          code. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ex. Function makeTea() { // function body }</li>
          <li>You then need to call the function. Ex. makeTea() ; </li>
          <li>Functions can wrap loops and if statments</li>
