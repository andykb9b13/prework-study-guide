# UNC Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is an interactive study guide for the material covered in the prework course of the UNC Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. There is a ton of material to cover and it will take some time to process it all so it was helpful to compile it into a webpage with easily readable sections. Through implementing the basic skills and process tools introduced during the prework course we've put into practice the things we will use as developers on a daily basis.
